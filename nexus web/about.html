    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Nexus Tech International Ltd was founded in 2024 by <strong>Jacob Adam , Founder & CEO</strong>, driven by a personal commitment to help people overcome barriers to opportunity. Witnessing the challenges skilled workers, refugees, and migrants face when trying to start anew in the UK, Jacob envisioned a company that provides not just services, but guidance, support, and empowerment.</p>
    <p>From helping a young professional navigate complex visa processes to assisting refugee families with relocation and welfare support, every success fuels our purpose. Our story is built on compassion, professionalism, and the belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, no matter where they come from.</p>
